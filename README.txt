Some uncleaned and mostly unready stuff from the Erlang-workshop I lectured in Metropolia spring 2013.

Homjakit is a start of a multi-programmer agent-game where the agents
compete for food and also try to hinder each other by laying
block-pieces around their competitors to slow them down. The
game-characters (actually some funny-looking Unicode characters from
Kannada, Amhara, etc. scripts) controlled by students agent-programs
from their PC's shared a common game-arena (n x n grid) which would
have been shown publicly with the projector of the class room / other
venue.

The idea was that these agents could not be actually killed by other
agents, but they could have been temporarily paralyzed by laying a big
layer of blocks around them. Also, of course the agent-controlling
program of the student could always crash, which from the viewpoint of
the server (and other agents) would just mean that his/her agent would
then just stay "in coma" in its current square, until the
agent-controlling program at student's PC were working again.

It was intended that my students would have started developing their own
agent-software from a simple, barely intelligent common template, but sadly,
I ran seriously out of time before getting the system up to that point, and then
the course was already over.
